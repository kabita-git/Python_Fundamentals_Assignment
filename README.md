Python Fundamental Assignment

This is a capstone project of a crash course in Python Programming. The project consists of different tasks
that has briefly clarified some basic features of Python. The different parts of this project are as follows:

1. The first task (data_types) is based on clarifying the concept of different data types in Python

2. The second task (control_structure) explains how different loops and conditionals work. In the program, I have used while loop and if else conditional.

3. The third task (calculator) is a simple calculator. The program takes two operands from the user and operates on them as per users choice.

4. The fourth and final task (todo_app) is a simple TO-DO list app that can add, delete and view the saved tasks. It is also programmed in a way that it covers most of the concepts like looping, conditionals, functions, file importing etc.
